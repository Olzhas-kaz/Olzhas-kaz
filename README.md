## Hi there, I'm Olzhas Turarov ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Lead Sales Support Engineer.<br>
Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science.<br>
Data Scientist with experience in implementing machine learning projects for the metallurgical, oil and gas and industrial industries. I constantly improve my skills, study professional literature and materials in English. Looking for an opportunity to apply subject matter expertise and Data Science skills to solve complex business problems.<br>
Analyzing data and drawing conclusions based on it is a very exciting process, but I get real satisfaction when I manage to get a model that the business needs! And then there is a feeling that you have done something useful! This motivates and charges me for new skills and projects.
